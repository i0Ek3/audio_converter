# audio converter

## Why?

I need fetch my recordings on my Pixel phone, but its' format is m4a not mp3 or others. So I decide write something to help me to convert this. Of course, thanks to pydub I can solve this problem easily. Well, we'll update this converter all the time to make it support more covnert function, but don't expect anything.

## Usage

Add your filename, savename and oformat in converter.py, and then run command `python3 converter.py`. 

## TODO

- error checking
- support more format type
- ...

## Credit

Pydub.
